## Description
In this exercise, we were tasked with developing a web application that allows users to perform CRUD operations on a database, along with the ability to search for specific data. The application is built using web development technologies such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and PHP.


## Instructions
To run the web application and test the CRUD with search functionality, follow these steps:

1. Import the database structure and sample data:
   - Open a MySQL client (e.g., phpMyAdmin).
   - Create a new database.
   - Import the `data.sql` file located in the `database/` directory into the newly created database.

2. Set up the web server:
   - Deploy the project files to a web server running PHP support.

3. Access the web application:
   - Open a web browser.
   - Enter the URL of the deployed web application.
   - You should now be able to use the CRUD with search functionality provided by the web application.
